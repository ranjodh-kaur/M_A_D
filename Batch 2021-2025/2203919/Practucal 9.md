## PRACTICAL 9 : Android Services and Threads:To implement the concept of multithreading using Android Service class.

In Android, debugging and testing an app is essential to identify and fix issues during development. Here’s an introduction to commonly used tools for debugging in Android Studio: **Logcat**, **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**, and **DDMS (Dalvik Debug Monitor Server)**.

### 1. Logcat

**Logcat** is a tool in Android Studio that shows system messages, including error and debug logs generated by your app. It's helpful for tracking app behavior and finding issues.

#### Steps to Use Logcat

1. **Add Log Statements in Code**: Use `Log` statements in your code to print messages that appear in Logcat.
2. **View Messages**: Open Logcat in Android Studio to see these messages.

#### Example Code with Log Statements

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private static final String TAG = "MainActivity";

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        Log.d(TAG, "App started");  // Debug message
        Log.i(TAG, "App is running"); // Info message
        Log.e(TAG, "An error occurred"); // Error message
    }
}
```

In the code above:
- `Log.d(TAG, "App started");` prints a debug message.
- `Log.i(TAG, "App is running");` prints an informational message.
- `Log.e(TAG, "An error occurred");` prints an error message.

To view these messages:
- Open **Logcat** at the bottom of Android Studio.
- Filter messages by **TAG** or **Log Level** (Debug, Info, Error) to view relevant logs.

### 2. Android Debug Bridge (ADB)

**ADB** is a command-line tool that allows communication with an Android device or emulator. You can use it to install apps, view logs, and access the device’s shell.

#### Common ADB Commands

1. **Connect to the Device**: 
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
   This command lists connected devices.

2. **Install an App**:
   ```bash
   adb install path/to/app.apk
   ```
   Replace `path/to/app.apk` with the path to your app’s APK file.

3. **Uninstall an App**:
   ```bash
   adb uninstall com.example.myapp
   ```
   Replace `com.example.myapp` with your app’s package name.

4. **View Logcat Output**:
   ```bash
   adb logcat
   ```
   This command displays log messages from the device, just like the Logcat tool in Android Studio.

5. **Start an App**:
   ```bash
   adb shell am start -n com.example.myapp/.MainActivity
   ```
   Replace `com.example.myapp/.MainActivity` with your app's package and main activity name.

#### Example: Using ADB to View Logs and Install an App

- Open a terminal, type `adb logcat`, and view log messages as they appear in real-time.
- Install the APK with `adb install` and start testing on the device directly.

### 3. DDMS (Dalvik Debug Monitor Server)

**DDMS** is a debugging tool for monitoring Android devices or emulators. It allows you to inspect and manage device memory, view running processes, and simulate hardware events.

> **Note**: DDMS was integrated into Android Studio in the **Android Profiler**, so you won’t find it as a standalone tool in recent Android Studio versions.

#### Using Android Profiler (Modern Alternative to DDMS)

1. **Start Android Profiler**: Open **Android Profiler** in Android Studio (bottom of the window).
2. **Choose Metrics**: Select metrics like **CPU**, **Memory**, **Network**, and **Energy** to monitor your app’s performance.
3. **View Real-Time Data**: Click on the metric you're interested in, such as **Memory**, to view memory usage and garbage collection.

#### Example: Analyzing Memory Usage in Android Profiler

1. Run your app in **Debug** mode.
2. Open **Android Profiler** and go to the **Memory** tab.
3. Click **Record** to start capturing memory allocations.
4. Observe the memory usage chart and look for issues like memory leaks.

### Summary

- **Logcat** is used for printing log messages to debug code.
- **ADB** is a command-line tool for managing apps and devices.
- **Android Profiler** (formerly DDMS) allows real-time performance analysis of CPU, memory, and network.

These tools provide a comprehensive suite for debugging and improving your Android app's stability and performance.
